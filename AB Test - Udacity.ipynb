It shows that the \"Free Trial Screener\" feature indeed filter out a few users by setting a clearer expectation for the students before they enroll in the course.<br/>\n",
    "However, we fail to reject the null hypothesis in Group B since the change in Net Conversion rate is neither statistically significant nor surpass the minimum practical effect size. That is, the decrease in percentage of users enrolled in free trial cannot be \"overly\" offset by higher Retention rate with students who are more likely to invest enough time during the learning process. In fact, we witness a slight decrease in this rate, whereas we set a positive dmin for NC, expecting the new feature can help us improve user experience without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course.Based on the data we have, we may even recommend Udacity not to launch this new feature if it aims to increase revenue gained through course payments. <br/>"

The functionality of \"Free Trial Screener\" is pretty simple and it's reasonable to assume many users find it out and make unrealistic \"promise\" during the screener. If it happens, then it's possible to see a further decrease in the Retention rate which makes us hard to tell whether Net Conversion rate will decrease. <br/>\n",
    "But in a longer time period, if we assume a steady coversion rate of users who start with free accessable course materials then make payment, an increase in number of people start with free materials may also bring us higher Net Conversion rate. Unfortunately, we don't data in this experiment to test this effect."
